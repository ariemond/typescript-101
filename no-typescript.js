// function add(a, b){
//     return a + b;
// };

// const result = add(2, 5);
// console.log(result);

// JS has types, for example, numbers.
// JS is dynamically typed. The function above does not expect any types.
// It just knows that it will receive two parameters and that's it.
// Nothing is warning you that you should not use this function for something like strings.
// That's where typescript can help.
